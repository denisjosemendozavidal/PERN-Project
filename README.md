Welcome to my very first Full Stack web, developed with the PERN stack (PosgreSQL, Express, React.js, Node.js) This is intended to be just a simple crud of users. 
The main idea behind this project was for me to understand how Front and Back relate to make a Full stack app possible. 


Next version of this app will have user validation among other features.
